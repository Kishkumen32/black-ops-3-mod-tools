This mod removes all of the Gobble Gum machines from the Black Ops 3 Zombies maps. Almost all of the guns have been replaced with Black Ops 1 and Black Ops 2 guns in the box. 

The starting pistol has been changed from the MR6 to the M1911. Phd Flopper has been added to all of the Black Ops 3 maps, and to Acension and Origins maps.

I plan on modifying the wall weapons eventually, to get rid of all of the Black Ops 3 weapons.

NOTE:
You can now complete the Main Quest on zetsubou no shima. There is a control panel to the left of where you fix the elevator. This control panel will teleport you to the dragon room, so you can pick up the cog.

To activate phd flooper, you need to jump and then slide. Make sure it is from at least a slight incline or it wont proc.
